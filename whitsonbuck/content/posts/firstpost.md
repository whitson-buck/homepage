# Welcome to my page. 

I plan on populating this with professional achievements and some personal musings -- using it as a half-portfolio, half-thought page.

(I like the terminal themed page. My wife thinks it's kind of dumb. It might be both.)

**Myself in a summary:** I am a perpetually curious individual with a knack for solving problems. I am a disciple of the scriptures and am seeking God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. My professional goal is the same as my personal goal: have just enough to do and be what is needed in my community (currently beautiful Knoxville, TN). I enjoy climbing, gaming, reading, and making maps.
