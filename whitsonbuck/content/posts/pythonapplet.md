#A lesson in chaotic data.

I've posted this on ![LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208499445242494977/), but I figured it would be appropriate to share on this page. This graduate school project was a high-level exercise in data wrangling, joining, manipulating, exploring, and analyzing. 

To give you an idea of now nothing came easy on this project, I chose to use a Levenshtein distance function across thousands of rows as a soft join. This was one of a few choices I made over the course of the project, given time restrictions and minimum requirements. If you are interested to read more about the methodologies I used, check out the ![Github repo](https://github.com/whitson-buck/textminingfinal).

Finally, the link you've all been so desperately waiting for. [Behold](https://whittybuck.pythonanywhere.com/).
